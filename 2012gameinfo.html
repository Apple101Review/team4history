<h1>Rebound Rumble</h1>
<p>In Rebound Rumble, each team controls a robot and is in an alliance with two other teams. Each alliance competes by scoring as many baskets as possible in a two-minute and fifteen-second time period. Baskets at different heights have varying point values. Teams can also score by balancing on a bridge located along the center of the field. Robots can not be as tall as a team wants them to be. There are rules that the robots and players must follow. If the players or the robots break any of the rules, the team recieves a foul. Fouls can either deduct points or disqualify players or robots.</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Alliances want to work together to score points by making baskets and balancing on bridges. Robots can either play defense or offense to help their alliance win. A defensive robot tries to stop the other team's offense robot from scoring. An offensive robot scores by successfully shooting basketballs in baskets. Robots can pick up foam balls from the ground or from a ball feeder. The robots can hold up to three balls at once. Robots can travel from each side of the field by either going over the barrier or crossing the bridge. The game is played on a field that is 27 by 54 ft. Players control their robots using a Microsoft Kinect during the Hybrid Period. Two Kinect stations are located outside the court.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>In Rebound Rumble points can be scored two ways: by shooting the ball in the basket and by balancing on the bridges. There are four baskets in the game, with one at the top, two in the middle and one on the bottom. Balls scored on the highest hoop are worth three points, balls scored on the middle hoops are worth two points, and balls scored on the lowest hoop are worth one point. Balancing on the bridges is worth more than scoring a basket. There are three bridges, and those on the outside are worth less than the the middle bridge, which requires a robot from each team in order to be balanced. Players can use the Kinect to motion-control their robot during the Hybrid Period. Points scored on the baskets are valued differently from the rest of the game. Baskets scored during the Hybrid Period are worth three more points than in the normal game.</p>
