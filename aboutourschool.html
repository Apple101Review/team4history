<h3>History</h3>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTLA was conceived as a model school for the 21st Century by education entrepreneur Roberta Weintraub in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District, a group of leading high-tech firms and nonprofit foundations. A replication site of High Tech High in San Diego, HTLA became the nation’s first charter school on the campus of another public school – Birmingham High – and opened the 2002-2003 school year in temporary quarters. The current state-of-the-art facility opened to students in time for the 2004-2005 school year. On July 1, 2008, HTLA became an independent California charter school. This year, HTLA is home to 366 students in grades 9-12 including 84 graduating, college-bound seniors.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innovative features include performance-based assessment, shared planning and meeting time for staff, state-of-the-art technical facilities for project-based learning, internships and connections to the community. Accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in 2007 we were honored as a California Distinguished High School.
