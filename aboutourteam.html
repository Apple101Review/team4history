&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team 4&apos;s roots began with Team 22 from Chatsworth High School. High Tech High split from Team 22 after two years and formed its own team in 2005. When registering, the team was given the opportunity to choose a retired team number, as it was not seen as a rookie team. Thus, Team 4 ELEMENT was established. ELEMENT stands for Engineering, Leadership, Entrepreneurship, Mentoring, Education, Networking, and Teamwork. The logo is the Phoenix, the colors are turquoise and black, and the motto is Igniting the Flames of Passion.
