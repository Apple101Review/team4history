	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello Team 4 members and parents. We are in our last week of build season and there is a lot of pressure on the team. At this point they have 3 days to complete the robot before the deadline. The students are working hard to achieve that goal and do well in this year&apos;s competitions.<br /><br />
	Programming is working on hybrid mode; they have finished all of the other modes. Shawn says the camera tracking system is almost perfect. The department is almost done with everything that they need to do, but they still need to test their code.<br /><div style="width:590px;padding:10px;background-color:black;color:#28FE14;font-family:Courier,serif">

if (team4.department == &quot;Programming&quot;) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(&quot;We are awesome!&quot;);<br />
} else {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(&quot;Meh...&quot;);<br />
}

	Design is almost finished with the robot drive base. William says everything looks good! They are in the process of fixing the bumper attachment. Design is also finishing the drawings for the lazy susan. <q>Everything that has been designed on Solid Works has been fully machined and now we need to assemble all of the parts onto the robot.</q>&nbsp;&#45;&nbsp;William Miguel<br /><br /><img src="images/rozie.png" widht="auto" height="auto" Title="Shooter" alt="Rozie and Jesus" /><br /> <br />
	Machining has completed producing all of the robot parts and are currently assisting other departments in assembling the robot.<br /><br />
	<q>Machining is having a very productive build season.</q> -Ben Bottomley Jesus tells us that electronics is wiring a few of the jags which are the speed controllers that power the motors. They are also mounting electronics onto the robot. <q>I am currently attaching the limit switches to the wedge.</q>&nbsp;&#45;&nbsp;Jordan Rodgers<br /><br />
	Finance currently has a lot to manage. The Spirit part of finance is organizing all the giveaways for competition.  Zoe is emailing parents. They are also sewing phoenix plushies. Robin is researching places for the team members to go to eat while on the Las Vegas trip. <q>I am currently writing a Las Vegas information letter to give out to the traveling team.</q>&nbsp;&#45;&nbsp;Robin<br /><br /><img src="images/jackson.png" widht="auto" height="auto" Title="Ben and Jackson" alt="Ben and Jackson" /><br /><br />
