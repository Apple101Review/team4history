	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello Team 4 members and parents. We are in our last week of build season and there is a lot of pressure on the team. At this point they have 3 days to complete the robot before the deadline. The students are working hard to achieve that goal and do well in this year&apos;s competitions.<br /><br />
	Programming is working on hybrid mode; they have finished all of the other modes. Shawn says the camera tracking system is almost perfect. The department is almost done with everything that they need to do, but they still need to test their code.<br /><img widht='auto' src='images/codeBlockQuote.png' Title='Code Quote' height='auto' alt='Programming Quote in Java' /><br />
	Design is almost finished with the robot drive base. William says everything looks good! They are in the process of fixing the bumper attachment. Design is also finishing the drawings for the lazy susan. <q>Everything that has been designed on Solid Works has been fully machined and now we need to assemble all of the parts onto the robot.</q>&nbsp;&#45;&nbsp;William Miguel<br /><br /><img widht='auto' src='images/rozie.png' Title='Shooter' height='auto' alt='Rozie and Jesus' /><br /> <br />
	Machining has completed producing all of the robot parts and are currently assisting other departments in assembling the robot.<br /><br />
	<q>Machining is having a very productive build season.</q> -Ben Bottomley Jesus tells us that electronics is wiring a few of the jags which are the speed controllers that power the motors. They are also mounting electronics onto the robot. <q>I am currently attaching the limit switches to the wedge.</q>&nbsp;&#45;&nbsp;Jordan Rodgers<br /><br />
	Finance currently has a lot to manage. The Spirit part of finance is organizing all the giveaways for competition.  Zoe is emailing parents. They are also sewing phoenix plushies. Robin is researching places for the team members to go to eat while on the Las Vegas trip. <q>I am currently writing a Las Vegas information letter to give out to the traveling team.</q>&nbsp;&#45;&nbsp;Robin<br /><br /><img widht='auto' src='images/jackson.png' Title='Ben and Jackson' height='auto' alt='Ben and Jackson' /><br /><br />

			08 Feb 2012<br />

				<p><html>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howdy Team 4 members and parents! We are having a very productive build season! We are getting ready for our upcoming Regional competitions in Long Beach and Las Vegas. The team members are putting in huge amounts of effort to make sure that our team is successful at building a beautiful, winning robot.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departments are all doing their part to make sure that our robot is completed on time. At this point, Rozie, head of design, says that design is finishing up some of their computer designs, and Andreas is designing the lazy susan for the robot for aiming the ball. He is also working on fine tuning the lazy susan, but they are still having trouble getting the dimensions right.<br /><img src='images/will.png' Title='will' height='auto' alt='will' width='auto' />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src='images/4robs.png' Title='5 Team Members' height='auto' alt='5 Team Members' width='auto' /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, head of electronics, reports that they just recently finished prototyping the shooter and they are getting the electronics for the turret completed. Electronics is also building a new electronics box for the robot and wedges to get the robot on the bridge.<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Justin, programming is very busy at the moment. They are programming the wedge and the camera, formalizing how fast they want the basketballs to shoot, and making sure everything is automated. They have also made some accomplishments such as developing a code for the bridge manipulator, drivetrain, ball control, the gyro, the turret, the camera, and FPGA(field programmer gate array). Justin plans to work on the PDI (proportion intergral derivative controller) which allows them to control the RPM of the robot&apos;s wheels<br /><br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spencer told us that machining is working in the shop; they are in the process of creating new pieces for the robot to function the way we designed it. They have assembled the ball collector mechanism and have begun manufacturing the shooter mechanism. Nick, head of machining, says, <q>This build season we have a lot of smart kids working very hard in the shop. I think it will be a very good year for Team 4.</q> <br /><br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still need to accomplish the hybrid mode. Josh is website scouting - looking at other competitors to see what they are doing with their robot. Programming says <q>nothing has been tested; therefore nothing has been broken yet.</q> <br /><br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the finance department is planning a restaurant night at Las Fuentes restaurant, so stay tuned for information on that. <br /><br />

			07 Jan 2012<br />

				<p><p><p>Hello all, and welcome to the 2012 FRC Build Season! This year&#8217;s game is <a href='http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/2012-rebound-rumble'>Rebound Rumble</a>, which is roughly based off basketball, hence the name.</p>

<p>This year, Team 4 got Build Season started right by showing up an hour early, 6AM on the west coast, and having a glorious breakfast available. If someone was, or could be covered in syrup or glaze we had it available for our team to keep trucking along after getting up at 5 in the early morning.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/73805787@N05/6656142001/' title='Kickoff Pancakes by team4element, on Flickr'><img class='alignleft' src='http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7154/6656142001_85b2c28921_z.jpg' alt='Kickoff Pancakes' /></a><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/73805787@N05/6656143437/' title='Kickoff Meeting by team4element, on Flickr'><img src='http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6656143437_8e2a468a11_z.jpg' alt='Kickoff Meeting' /></a><div style='clear:both'>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Once this year&#8217;s technical difficulties were sorted out (I do still wonder what OSPREY is) we all watched and waited with bated breath for this year&#8217;s game animation and the manual password. We started picking up on the not-so-subtle hints (why are they wearing basketball jerseys? hmmm&#8230; must be a water game) during kickoff. Once &#8220;Rebound Rumble&#8221; was finally announced everyone with a computer at hand was trying to type &#8216;!HotShot!KnowBalance!&#8217; without making any typos as fast as possible.</p>

<p>We broke up into groups by our process departments, Machining, Programming, Electronics, Design &amp; Research, and a catch-all for Finance, and started reading through the rules. Every group approached this differently, but every group went into incredible detail. The game was done being announced at around 8:45 AM and we continued to all deliberate on the rules until noon in our small groups.</p>

<p>At noon we gathered up all the small groups and brought everyone together to make sure they were all on one page. Any discrepancies between what the groups thought the rules meant were ironed out, and some facts we had all missed (namely that the bridges are on double-hinges) were brought to light.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/73805787@N05/6656144827/' title='Kickoff Simulation by team4element, on Flickr'><img src='http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7011/6656144827_c534e32f4f_z.jpg' alt='Kickoff Simulation' /></a>
<p>With everyone on the same page we broke for a well deserved lunch. We came back now organized in more diverse groups, and started to run &#8216;simulations&#8217; of the game. Over lunch we had created half-sized fields for everyone to act out the game on, and played the games turn-by-turn. There were a bunch of rules designed to make turn by turn play function similarly to the actual game though many were changed on-the-fly because our goal was just to see roughly how the game would work. <div style='clear:both'>&nbsp;</div></p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/73805787@N05/6656145835/' title='Kickoff sorting priorities by team4element, on Flickr'><img src='http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6656145835_3edaa4fb1a_z.jpg' alt='Kickoff sorting priorities' /></a>
<p>Our real goal was to generate &#8216;task lists&#8217; or &#8216;strategic objective lists&#8217; as some called them, which were simple listings of everything that you could do during the game. We figured out what you could actually do by having everyone play as robots and try different things. By doing this even with our relatively arbitrary movement rules we got an idea for how long it would take to do everything and how often we might need to do certain things.</p>

<p>With our newly-found knowledge of how the game played out we started sorting out our priorities in each group. We were going to try coalescing all of these into one master list to act as our team&#8217;s objectives for the season, until we realized it was 3PM. We had been at our school, working for about 9 hours. On a Saturday.</p>

<p>Good luck, think hard, and we&#8217;ll see Team 4 on Monday.</p></p></p>
