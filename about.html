<h1>FIRST Introduction</h1>
<h2><q>For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology</q></h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRST is a non-profit organization with the mission to inspire high school students in math, science and technology. It was founded by Dean Kamen in 1989 and has since grown to more than 4000 teams, and has spread to other countries such as Canada, Brazil, England, and Israel.
FIRST also promotes the philosophy of <q>gracious professionalism,</q> a term used to describe a
code of behavior which values community, promotes quality in work, and emphasizes respectful
behavior toward others.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), teams from around the world compete in a game created by FIRST. The rules of the game are revealed to the teams in January, in an event
that <q>kicks off</q> build season. Build season continues for six more weeks, at the end of which the
robots are shipped to competition sites.

<h2>Team Introduction</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team 4&apos;s roots began with Team 22 from Chatsworth High School. High Tech High split from Team 22 after two years and formed its own team in 2005. When registering, the team was given the opportunity to choose a retired team number, as it was not seen as a <q>rookie</q> team. Thus, Team 4 ELEMENT was established. ELEMENT stands for Engineering, Leadership, Entrepreneurship, Mentoring, Education, Networking, and Teamwork. The logo is the Phoenix, the colors are turquoise and black, and the motto is <q>Igniting the Flames of Passion.</q>

<h2>Team Structure</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentors, Teachers, Parents and Administrators</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the primary goal of all adults associated with the team and school for the team to be successful, and to provide a healthy and cooperative environment for team members and other
involved parties.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities of the mentors include providing students will personal and professional tools
they need to function and succeed as a team. The teacher mentors will document attendance and
monitor the hours of each team member. Privileges given to individuals, such as use of school
materials and equipment, team membership, and trip attendance will be determined by teachers
and mentors. Teacher mentors also determine eligibility due to grades and commitment. All
team activities must be approved by the principal.
